<p>Milkymist was founded in summer 2007 by Sébastien Bourdeauducq. The open source project tackled the development of a system-on-chip design capable of running MilkDrop. The name "Milkymist" was chosen to evoke a parallel MilkDrop. The development was no small task, as it required designing and/or integrating a powerful 32-bit microprocessor core, basic peripherals, many interfaces, a fast SDRAM controller, and graphics acceleration. The video synthesizer born out of those efforts, the <a href="m1.html">Milkymist One</a>, was launched in September 2011 with the help of open hardware company Sharism at Work.</p>

<p>Components of the Milkymist system-on-chip soon found many other uses, such as <a href="jpl_letter.jpg">software-defined radio</a> on board the International Space Station. The community grew and activities diversified, with the development of a <a href="http://www.ohwr.org/projects/tdc-core/wiki">TDC core</a> for CERN (using a variant of the Milkymist SoC for integration), the <a href="gateware.html">Migen</a> logic design system and its application to the Rhino software-defined radio platform, and the <a href="mixxeo.html">Mixxeo</a> digital video mixer. In 2013, Milkymist was renamed to M-Labs to mark the more varied activities. It is formally incorporated as M-Labs Limited.</p>

<p>The company's current main project is <a href="artiq/index.html">ARTIQ</a>, a next-generation open source control system for quantum information experiments.</p>

	<h2>Get in touch</h2>

<p>We'd love to hear from you! Here how you can communicate with us.</p>
<p>For most questions and feedback, the best way is to use <a href="https://ssl.serverraum.org/lists/listinfo/devel/">the mailing list</a>. If you do not know how, simply send your message to devel at lists dot m-labs dot hk. Sébastien's email address is sb at m-labs dot hk but it is often better to use the mailing list (for example, other people may reply to technical questions, and answers stay archived and searchable).</p>
<p>A good means of contact is also the <a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=m-labs">IRC channel #m-labs</a> on Freenode.</p>
<p>Finally, you can follow our <a href="http://twitter.com/M_Labs_Ltd">Twitter account</a>.</p>
<p>Patches should be sent to the mailing list, preferably using git-format-patch. Please do not use GitHub pull requests.</p>
