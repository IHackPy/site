<p>Milkymist was founded in summer 2007 by Sébastien Bourdeauducq. The open source project tackled the development of a system-on-chip design capable of running MilkDrop. The name "Milkymist" was chosen to evoke a parallel MilkDrop. The development was no small task, as it required designing and/or integrating a powerful 32-bit microprocessor core, basic peripherals, many interfaces, a fast SDRAM controller, and graphics acceleration. The video synthesizer born out of those efforts, the <a href="m1.html">Milkymist One</a>, was launched in September 2011 with the help of open hardware company Sharism at Work.</p>

<p>Components of the Milkymist system-on-chip soon found many other uses, such as <a href="jpl_letter.jpg">software-defined radio</a> on board the International Space Station. The community grew and activities diversified, with the development of a <a href="http://www.ohwr.org/projects/tdc-core/wiki">TDC core</a> for CERN (using a variant of the Milkymist SoC for integration), the <a href="gateware.html">Migen</a> logic design system and its application to the Rhino software-defined radio platform, and the <a href="mixxeo.html">Mixxeo</a> digital video mixer. In 2013, Milkymist was renamed to M-Labs to mark the more varied activities, and formally incorporated in Hong Kong as M-Labs Limited.</p>

<p>The company's current main project is <a href="artiq/index.html">ARTIQ</a>, a leading-edge open source control system for quantum information experiments. In 2016, Robert Jördens joined the directorate of the company to further develop ARTIQ and other physics-related projects.</p>
