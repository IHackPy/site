<h2>June 23rd 2016, 20:00 &mdash; Lecture: Harnessing social media data with machine learning</h2>

<p>
	Judging others' psychological traits is not only an essential skill in successful social living, but also an important factor in product development. Psychological traits are a key driver behind human interaction, behavior and emotions. Although accurate judgments stem from social-cognitive skills, developments in machine learning show that computer models can also make valid judgments. It is also possible that this technique can assist clinical diagnosis in the future.

<h2>March 3rd 2016, 20:00 &mdash; Projection of QED lectures by Richard Feynman</h2>

<p>We will get together to watch and discuss the excellent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8590A6E18255B3F4">lectures on quantum electrodynamics</a> (QED) that Richard Feynman originally gave at the University of Auckland in 1979. QED is a strange, beautiful and fundamental theory from which many intuitive or extremely counter-intuitive predictions (e.g. quantum paradoxes) about light and matter can be made. Many have been verified experimentally with much precision. The lectures present the theory in a witty and accessible manner.</p>

<p>Event open to all. Bring drinks and snacks.</p>

<p><i>&laquo; The theory of quantum electrodynamics describes Nature as absurd from the point of view of common sense. And it agrees fully with experiment. So I hope you accept Nature as She is &mdash; absurd. &raquo;</i> &mdash; Richard Feynman</p>

<h2>Getting there</h2>
<p><b>The lab's address is:</b><br />
M-Labs Limited<br />
