<p>Built on the <a href="gateware.html">MiSoC and Migen</a> technologies that originated from the development experience of the Milkymist One and unlike other mixers, the Mixxeo itself does everything and processes every pixel with our own <a href="http://github.com/m-labs">open source hardware and software</a>. This gives us exceptional control and customization possibilities.</p>

<p>The Mixxeo supported mixing from two DVI or HDMI sources up to 720p60, with crossfade, fade to black and potentially other effects with a latency of less than two frames.</p>

<p><b>Status (Aug 2014)</b> - Main board and gateware have been <a href="mixxeo_result.jpg">mostly functional</a> for a while, mechanical design and manufacturing for the case/mechatronics are progressing slowly. If you have the skills and would like to help out, email sb at m-labs.hk or the mailing list.</p>
