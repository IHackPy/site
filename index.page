<h4>ARTIQ</h4>
<p>ARTIQ (Advanced Real-Time Infrastructure for Quantum physics) is a leading-edge control system for quantum information experiments, developed in partnership with a growing number of research institutions worldwide.</p>

<p>The system features a high-level programming language that helps describe complex experiments, which is compiled and executed on dedicated hardware with nanosecond timing resolution and sub-microsecond latency.</p>

<h4>Gateware and system-on-chip design</h4>
<p>
Traditional gateware design with Verilog and VHDL is well known to be tedious and inefficient. M-Labs have developed Migen, a Python-based HDL and toolbox that addresses many of their issues and makes gateware design more productive.
</p>

<p>
Built on Migen, MiSoC provides a high performance, flexible and lightweight solution to build system-on-chips for various applications.
